**Data professional based in Brazil**

I am currently getting a Master's degree in Data Science and Analytics at "Luiz de Queiroz" College of Agriculture, University of SÃ£o Paulo (ESALQ/USP) and I have a Chemical Engineering degree from Unicamp.

I've worked for over 3 years at [Loft](https://loft.com.br/), a fast-growing technology startup. There, I developed experience with data modeling, detection of data quality problems, creation of visualizations, charts, analyses, and identification of opportunities to improve business processes.
